# indesign-mass-combine
A simple script that combines all indesign files in a single folder into one indesign document.

**just fyi**
* This was last tested with CS5 but it seems like, routinely, Adobe updates break the script. I know there are currently issues with CS6, so if you have CS6 and have solved the problem, I'd highly appreciate it if you created a pull request with the required changes.
* It will arrange all the files alphabetically by filename. Useful for pages.

## In order to use:
* Place all the files you want to merge into a single document into one folder. It shouldn't break if you have other, non indesign files in there but for safety sake, try to only have indesign folders in there.
* Create a new indesign document
* Run this script, choosing the folder with all the files.

Hooray!
